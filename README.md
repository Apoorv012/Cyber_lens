 # Cyber Lens

Cyber Lens is a **Threat Intelligence & IOC Analysis Platform** built as part of a month-long open-source contribution event by the **Cyber Security Wing**.

The project focuses on collecting, analyzing, and correlating Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as IPs, domains, URLs, and hashes using multiple threat intelligence providers — all wrapped in a clean full-stack architecture.

---

## What is Cyber Lens?

Cyber Lens allows users to:
- Submit an IOC (IP, domain, URL, hash, etc.)
- Query multiple threat intelligence providers in parallel
- Aggregate results into a single **score & verdict**
- View historical lookups
- Read security news with extracted IOCs
- Visualize analytics and threat trends

This repository is intentionally **partially implemented** to encourage learning through contributions.
